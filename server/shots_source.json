And I wanted to share an interaction we‚Äôve been experimenting on iPad, in order to allow users to quickly browse long documents and get to a certain page. Most reader use sliders to jump between pages, but you never get the chance to actually see the page you‚Äôre about to land on. So, we worked on something that allows you to zoom out, get a more high level view of your document and quickly navigate among pages. All done in Principle üôå </p>‚Üµ‚Üµ<p>I hope you‚Äôll like it and as always, press L to show some love ‚ù§</p>"
